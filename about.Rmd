### Hello!

I am currently attending Columbia University for my MS in biostatistics and pharmaceutical statistics, and I am also working part-time at Columbia Irving Medical Centerâ€™s data management unit. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a BS in public health epidemiology and a minor in business. Feel free to contact me at wang.eric@columbia.edu!

Feel free to [connect](connect.html) with me!
