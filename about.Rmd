Hello! I am currently attending Columbia University for my MS in biostatistics with a focus on pharmaceutical statistics, where I was awarded the Columbia Mailman Scholarship in Public Health. I am currently working full-time in Columbia Irving Medical Centerâ€™s biostatistics department as a Data Management Specialist, but it will be back to part-time during the school year. I graduated from UC San Diego in 2021 with a BS in public health epidemiology and a minor in business. Feel to contact me at wang.eric@columbia.edu. Also, don't forget to [connect](connect.html) with me on social media :)
