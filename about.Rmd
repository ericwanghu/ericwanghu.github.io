I am currently attending Columbia University for my MS in biostatistics and pharmaceutical statistics, and I am also working part-time in Columbia Irving Medical Centerâ€™s data management unit. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a BS in public health epidemiology and a minor in business. I am actively looking for a 2022 summer internship within the biostatistics and public health fields.Feel free to contact me at wang.eric@columbia.edu! Also, don't forget to [connect](connect.html) with me on social media :)
